As developers, a significant proportion of our time is browsing through online developer communities, trying to find solutions to smaller of bigger problems we face, as well as offering our help when we can. This document is an attempt to include (most of) the sources of the chunks of code that were found elsewhere, adapted for, and implemented in this project.

This will be of tremendous help, both for contributors, that will be able to understand the code better, and for other developers who just liked something from the project and would like to implement it their projects.
