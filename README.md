# Documentation
Will be released with version 1.0.0. In the meantime, you can refer to the [Tone.js documentation](https://tonejs.github.io/docs/).


# Guides & Tutorials
There aren't any guides and tutorials specifically for the JSS-01 yet, but there are plenty of excellent guides on the types of sound synthesis that the JSS-01 is using:

(Currently JSS-01 only has an FM mode implementing the FMSynth of Tone.js)

# Changelog
Please refer to the project's [Changelog](https://github.com/michaelkolesidis/javascript-software-synthesizer/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) document.



# Technologies Used
* [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/)
<br>One  could say that Tone.js is the "soul" of our project. It provides us with the synthesizers we use to generate sounds, as well as their various properties that can be tweaked and adjusted.
* [NexusUI](https://github.com/nexus-js/ui)
<br>NexusUI provides us with the UI components that are connected to the synthesizers and make parameters adjusting easy and playful.
* [WEBMIDI.js](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi)
<br>WEBMIDI.js makes Web MIDI API easy to implement. It allows users to connect their MIDI keyboards and play the synthesizer the way it is meant to be played. Because, who likes playing music with a mouse?
* [Sass](https://github.com/sass/sass)
<br>The SCSS (Sassy CSS) syntax is utilized for the styling of our project.
* [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli)
<br>Everyone's beloved packet manager.

# Roadmap
Some of the ideas are full modular design, full compatibility with MIDI controllers, implementation of all Tone.js features, and in the (very) distant future even our own synth engines along with Tone.js.

None, yet! We will have to add way more features for that.



# Mascot
Can there be a respectful project without a mascot? Of course not. Thus, we are to present you Jesse the Lizard, the official mascot of the JSS-01 project! Jesse goes by the pronouns "they/them" and can be found lying around in all sorts of places around the project. Look out for them!

Trivia:
* Jesse's favourite food is bugs (we do our best to feed them)
* Jesse has the ability has the ability to change theis skin coloration
