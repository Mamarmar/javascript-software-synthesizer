# Contributing

First off, **thank you** for considering to contribute! We aim to build an 
inclusive community around the JSS-01 project. You should know that there 
are many ways to contribute. You can write tutorials, create videos or blog posts, 
improve the documentation, submit bug reports or feature requests, as well as write 
actual code. All of these are very worthwhile contributions and are more than welcome!

All contributors will be added in the designated section in the project's readme file.

Please contact us for any inquiries :)
